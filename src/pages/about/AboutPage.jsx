                        You kept it close — because putting it down was too difficult. You took your favorite popular books everywhere — just to read a couple of pages in a spare moment. And if you want your readers to do the same with your book, then you make it a paperback.

                        What's a paperback book?

                    <p>
                        Paperback books (also known as softcover or softback books) are typically made with a thick paper or cardboard book cover and held together with flexible glue binding, or perfect binding. They’re small and lightweight, making them perfect travel companions. Paperbacks are also popular for many book styles, including children’s fiction, young adult fiction, romance, poetry, graphic novels, and religious books.
